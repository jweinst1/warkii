`Warkii` is a natural language generator implemented in Scala that can write six word stories. It is linked with a twitter account to publish the stories for anyone to view.

## Documentation

Warkii itself is implemented using entirely a functional programming approach. You can find the documentation below

### Process

The stories are constructed via "components", or pairs and triplets of words that carry a small piece of knowledge. These phrases hold some piece of communicative information that can be strung into a story.


### Name

The name `Warkii` comes from the Somali language and means story. I chose this name because Somali society is almost synonymous with poetry.
